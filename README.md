#Markdown Wiki (Currently Needs a Better Name)

#To Run
1. Clone Repository
1. Change document route in config file
1. Visit url in browser

#Dependencies
* PHP (Haven't tested many versions yet, works with 5 though)
* Apache? Obviously
	* Mod_Rewrite must be installed/enabled, or else some links will have to be fudged. Maybe I will put a mode in at some point to allow for servers with no permalinks

* Should be it. Markdown interpreter included, no DB.
